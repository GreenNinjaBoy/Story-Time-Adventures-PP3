Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful princess named Isabella. 
One fateful night, an evil sorcerer named Malachar cast a dark spell upon the kingdom, 
causing Princess Isabella to disappear without a trace. The entire kingdom fell into despair, 
and it was believed that only a brave and noble soul could rescue the princess and break the curse.

You, a courageous young adventurer, hear the kingdom's cry for help. 
You embark on a journey to find Princess Isabella and restore peace to the enchanted land. 
As you set out, you come across three different paths:

You decide to take the forest trail, hoping to find clues about Princess Isabella's whereabouts in the heart of nature.
As you venture deeper into the forest, you encounter a talking squirrel named Squeaky. He offers you two options:
You decide to trust the talking squirrel and follow his advice, believing he might lead you to Princess Isabella.
You ignore the talking squirrel and continue on your own, thinking you can find the princess without his help.

You choose to explore the mysterious abandoned castle on the hill, suspecting that it might hide secrets related to the princess's disappearance.
You opt to seek the wisdom of the wise sage, hoping to gain valuable insights and guidance on how to rescue the princess.
