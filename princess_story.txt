Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful princess named Isabella. 
One fateful night, an evil sorcerer named Malachar cast a dark spell upon the kingdom, 
causing Princess Isabella to disappear without a trace. The entire kingdom fell into despair, 
and it was believed that only a brave and noble soul could rescue the princess and break the curse.

You, a courageous young adventurer, hear the kingdom's cry for help. 
You embark on a journey to find Princess Isabella and restore peace to the enchanted land.

When you pick the amulet up, a magical portal appears infornt of you.

Stepping through it, you discover Princess Isabella trapped in a crystal cage. Utilizing the enchanted amulet,
you break the cage and free the princess. She thanks you profusely, and together, you return to the kingdom.

You choose to explore the mysterious abandoned castle on the hill, suspecting that it might hide secrets related to the princess's disappearance.
You opt to seek the wisdom of the wise sage, hoping to gain valuable insights and guidance on how to rescue the princess.
