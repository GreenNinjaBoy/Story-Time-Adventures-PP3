Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, 
there was a little astronaut named Alex. 
Alex had always dreamed of exploring the vast universe and discovering new planets. 
One day, while playing in the backyard, a magical spaceship, shaped like a colorful rocket, 
landed right in front of Alex!

"Hello, brave explorer! I am Cosmo, your friendly space companion. 
Are you ready for a cosmic adventure?" 
Cosmo asked, his eyes twinkling like stars.
