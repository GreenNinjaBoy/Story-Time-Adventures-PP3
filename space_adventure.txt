Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, 
there was a little astronaut named Alex. 
Alex had always dreamed of exploring the vast universe and discovering new planets. 
One day, while playing in the backyard, a magical spaceship, shaped like a colorful rocket, 
landed right in front of Alex!

"Hello, brave explorer! I am Cosmo, your friendly space companion. 
Are you ready for a cosmic adventure?" 
Cosmo asked, his eyes twinkling like stars.
I have 2 adventures for you.

Excitedly, Alex and Cosmo set off towards the Stardust Galaxy. 
As they zoomed through space, they saw planets made entirely of candy, 
and sparkling comets that lit up the sky like fireworks.
Cosmo asks Alex what they would like to do.
